I have a vague feeling of a memory of hearing about their first ""blood test patch"" patent and product, thinking, huh, thats amazing. It was amazing because it was a lie, there never was such a thing as a ""blood test patch"" but that didn't stop Elizabeth Holmes from raising millions from rich family friends like Tim Draper and her families ""Fleischmann Yeast"" fortune to fund her new fake company when she was only 19 years old. This book is about, Elizabeth Holmes, who was (is) a psychopathic rich girl who (because of her family wealth and connections) was able to eliminate anyone around her who told her ""no"" and built a billion dollar company (Theranos) based on nothing but lies and her families' money.   ""Hate is like drinking poison and expecting it to harm your enemy,"" but still, I hate Elizabeth Holmes. <br><br>She started rich, was given everything, dropped out of one of the best schools in the world after just 1 year, and somehow got people to believe that she had INVENTED a device that could do what all of the large clinical testing companies had been trying to do for decades. After finishing freshman year, Holmes had her father's lawyer help her ""write a patent"" for an ""idea"" of a patch that could somehow, test your blood. It would be no different if Holmes has said she had ""invented"" a more efficient form of flight and was going to sell her idea to airline companies, saving them billions of dollars. <br> <br>The biggest question of me is still just why. Why did anyone fall for this, why did no one tell those people how stupid the concept was or why did it take so long? If it really is this easy to become a $10 billion company, why are we not seeing a lot more nonsense ideas out there in this category? To anyone paying attention to Theranos, it was clear it was never anything other than a stock option pyramid scheme, destined to fail. To anyone paying attention to Elizabeth Holmes, it was clear that she was lying and, for some reason, doing a weird fake deep voice thing. I mean, the voice alone, if you have not heard this fake voice thing she does, please do, its weird. <br><br>In Bad Blood author, John Carreyrou details the story of how Elizabeth Holmes would be ""caught"" using her real voice in the office during late nights or when she thought she was otherwise alone. Like, what kind of a nut FAKES THEIR VOICE for years on end. On the upside though, this has given me a renewed meaning to my life, find out what Holmes' ""real voice"" sounds like.  This was a great book and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone who has been completely obsessed with Theranos and Holmes for the last decade and have been aching for the downfall of this obvious lunatic and her fake company. My only hope is that the take down of Trump is as sweet as watching Holmes fail in every excruciating detail in this amazing book. "

If you have, you may have come away with             the vague feeling that no one has any idea what really happened and             never will. Almost certainly though, the official ""Lone Gunman""             theory, just doesn't quite add up. If this has ever bugged you,             author Collin McLaren is ready and eager to scratch that itch in             this excellent piece of investigative journalism! McLaren perfectly             lays out what is known about that day and from a law enforcement             perspective, what is most likely to have taken place. Almost             certainly Oswald would not have been able to fire three shots as was             detailed in the Warren commission. Aside from some impossibly grand             conspiracy, the only other logical explanation for the assassination             and following cover up is, wait for it... (unless you already know             the answer, but for everyone else...), it was... an accident. Yep,             the fatal mistake was accidentally made by Secret Service agent             George Hickey, riding in the car behind the President. Oswald would             have been perched ahead (and above) of the motorcade and shot             twice.� It was the car behind the President that attempted to             return fire after the first shot, essentially over the President's             head toward the book depository. For whatever reason, that fateful             bullet instead of being aimed at the book depository hit the             President in the back of the head, causing the famous forward             jerking motion after exploding the back of the head onto the rear of             the vehicle. <br>             <br>             Anyway, if you want to read one Australian man's fairly reasonable             conclusion of what might have happened that day, this is a great             read. McLaren sounds like a great private dick and he clearly is             both qualified to have undertaken this massive investigation and in             his conclusions based on available evidence. I know there is a movie             too and tried to get the significant other watch it with me, but             having just put kids to sleep we were having trouble enjoying the             multiple close up replays of the infamous head-shots right at the             beginning of the film and turned it off after about 10 minutes."

This is an incredible book about a young cyber-punk hero,               Wade, who needs to beat the evil MegaCorp in the World's Greatest               Video game in order to save the world (the video game world) from               being lost (be subject to a small fee to play rather than be               free).<br>               <br>               The author paints a beautifully depressing picture of a dark and               dying future where most people spend their time in virtual reality               with some kind of full body feed-back suit that lets them interact               with the video game world, called the Oasis.<br>               <br>               I shouldn't give too much away about how and why our hero is a               starving, video game addicted homeless teenager playing in a game               for his life in virtual reality against the World's largest and               most evil company, but I can tell you this is a hell of a               dystopian ride and I would recommend it to everyone that wants a               great story and to feel really shitty about the future we are               leaving our children at the same time.<br>               <br>               From the start, the concept is great, nearly everything is told               from within the video game. At times games are being played within               ""the game"" and the reader is completely taken in to the virtual               world along with the characters. Of course the author plays with               ideas like people forgetting to eat, sleep, or keep their               real-life bodies warm while they are in game and we get to have a               lot of fun imaging their world, where anyone can slip away from               the real at anytime into their own personally designed digital               heaven.<br>               <br>               A great read, I'll be looking for more from Ernest Cline ASAP, now               I gotta unplug get back to reality for a bit :(<br>                        </p>           </div>"

With a sweetness of tone, bordering on being             endearing, he destroys the last hope we may have had that the IMF             and World Bank are anything other than fascist organizations with no             other goals than to keep the third world in an ever deepening             despair. To me, the central argument is summed up by the question             posed by Chang, why does the IMF require every county they fund to             ""balance their books"" at the end of every calendar year? It is a             simple requirement to get IMF ""adjudication"". This is a high             standard that even the US does not hold itself to. When we were in             dire straits after 9/11 what did we do? Spent our way out of it,             going more in debt than ever. What do we do in good times? Balance             our books? No way, we just keep racking up more and more debt. So             how can we possibly force small developing countries to be better             than us?<br>             <br>             Anyway, there are a ton a great examples in this great book. Bottom             line, everything is fake, the government is out to get you, the news             lies and even the very economic system we depend on is rigged             against 99% of people on the planet for the benefit of a very select             few Western European and North American well meaning plutocrats."

This one from Bernie             sums up perfectly how inspiring Bernie Sanders has been for me             personally and how amazing this book was. This campaign memoir is an             amazing take on American politics in 2016, from the seemingly total             blindness to suffering Americans from the big wigs at top like the             Clintons to the downright evil tactics of the Republican party to             keep the wealthy, wealthy and the poor discouraged and             disenfranchised. <br>             <br>             I voted in the primaries for Bernie and being a distopian at heart,             proudly proclaimed the next day that by taking the primary from             Bernie, Hilary was giving the office to Trump and I still believe             this 100%. Bernie lays out clearly how toward the end, EVERYONE knew             that he had a better shot of beating Trump, EVERYONE knew Hilary was             going to have a hard time and Bernie would have clear shot. But damn             Hilary if she didn't have to have her time to shine, the country be             damned.<br>             <br>             The second we lost Bernie as a candidate the liberal agenda was for             the first time in almost 10 years, called into serious question.             Hilary was practically doomed from the start. As people screamed for             anti-establishment candidates, the Dems gave us another Clinton. We             could be living in a world of free education, healthcare, flying             cars, 100gb 6g internet and who knows what else if Bernie would have             been ALLOWED to become president by Hillary, oh well.<br>             <br>             This is a great book, Bernie is a great man, too bad we missed out             on being a great country for another 8 years."

It is not too far off to think of sleep as the default state of living creatures. It is not so much that ants do not sleep (as the old assumption goes) but it is that they never ""wake up"". Like any physical system seeking the lowest energy equilibrium, sleep is that equilibrium for animals. For us, the most important functions of sleep seem to be restoration and enhancement, sleep heals both the mind and body.  <br><br> Author, Matthew Walker addresses many human afflictions and in turn, traces its root cause to a lack of sleep. People that sleep more tend toward more happiness, longer lives, higher IQ's and more. Lack of sleep in turn causes depression, stress, higher rates of divorce and even suicide. The point is made excruciatingly clear, you need more sleep, I need more sleep, everyone needs is be asleep 8 hours a night in a dark quiet room, no questions asked. That is the minimum, if you care about yourself or the people around you, you will see to the 8 hours plus a minimum of a 1 hour nap around noon. We need to turn off all light emitting devices three hours before we get into bed he tells us, especially no blue tinted LED's, the worst apparently. <br><br>  But there is more bad news, those ""sleeping aids"", they don't work and they are killing you. Dr. Walker tells us (clinically) there is no such thing as a sleep aid, we have sedatives, but that's it. We can sedate ourselves, but there is no one that considers sedation the same as sleep. Studies show that indeed, these two states are not the same, just because a person is non-responsive does not mean they are in one of the well defined ""sleep stages"". Even melatonin, says the author, is at best a placebo that is harming your kidneys. If for some reason you want to be unconscious in your bed at a given time, then sleep aids work, but as far as getting to sleep or staying asleep, the author says there is no compound that has ever been show to be effective. <br><br>  I loved this book. I knew I was not getting enough sleep but this book gave me the initiative and tools to work toward a better night's sleep. After a month of trying what I read in Why We Sleep I can't say I feel any better, I put up darker shades in the bedroom, I try to drink less coffee, go to bed earlier, but nothing really feel different. Dr. Walker is able to and does a great job of tell us what is wrong and what to do better, but my guess is that most of us are treating our own bodies like crap not because we don't know any better but that we don't care or even worse, are downright self destructive and withholding sleep is a well know method of torture."

Hillary tells how the group proceeded around the table             telling the waitress, in turn, how each had met Hillary and at least             one INCREDIBLE thing Hillary had done for them. One friend told of             the time that her son had fallen off his bike and scratched his             face, Hillary was able to ""pull some strings"" and get an appointment             with ""Washington's best plastic surgeon"" the very next morning for             the boy and after a short procedure, thankfully, there was never any             sign of a scar"", and on and on....<br>             <br>             It took me months to get around to writing this review and I am             still heated at the thought of how close this insane woman came to             the White House. I don't know how but this county managed to hold an             election between the two worst possible people. Before November 6 I             would have said that Trump was the obvious worse choice (of course I             voted Hillary (I'm not insane)) but today, after one year of Trump             and reading this book, I can say 100% that this county, nay, The             World, dodged a bullet the day we chose not to elect this lunatic to             the White House. <br>             <br>             I could go on and on about the insanity of this woman, the utter             lack of regard for realty, he total disconnection from people, her             attitude and justifications for failure are just sickening. If you             want to spend 30+ hours vomiting little by little into your mouth,             then you should read this book, for everyone else, just believe me             when I say that even though Trump this the worst thing to EVER             happen to this county, Hillary would have been worse. <br>             <br>             The self serving stories like the above go on, and on, and on as             Hillary drones about how difficult (and normal) her upbringing was             and how difficult (and totally normal) her life has been for the             last 20 years in ""public service"". That's right, somehow Hillary has             confused living on the dole with a private 24 hour security service             for the last 20 years as somehow ""service"".</div>"

At that same time, for example, just one group of             pirates in the middle east was demanding $100,000 per year as             tribute to not attack US merchant ships. In the beginning, essential             trade by sea was done at the peril of bad weather, old ships,             mutinous seamen and, of course, fucking pirates.<br>             <br>             <br>             For most of ""modern"" history pirates were and still are the             wealthiest people in the world. This amazing book walks us though             how at the birth of a nation pirates succeeded in bringing our third             president to his knees and how the US finally gained the upper hand.<br>             <br>             This. Was. An. Amazing. Book. I think it must be a rare combination             to get an incredible story in history along with such an incredibly             story teller. Brian Kilmeade weaves an incredible drama that starts             with setting the scene of the day by giving a sense of the real fear             that pirates inspired. They were the worst of the worst and bled             nations dry financially and morally. Jefferson's fear went so far as             to refuse to allow his daughter to travel on any US ships, only             French and British, as they were know to pay the highest ""tariffs""             to the pirates.<br>             <br>             With the fear of god properly instilled, Brian tells story after             incredible story of heroicism by US Navy men. Literally fighting             pirates hand to hand in the harbor of Tripoli, or the US filling a             ship full of explosives and sending toward an enemy boat.<br>             <br>             Or about how a US ship was (falsely) flying a British flag, then             pulled along side a pirate ship all nice like, ""Jolly day, Pip, pip,             right. Seen any Americans out? Those dandies."" And the pirates said,             ""It is unlucky that today we have not seen any Americans as I would             have liked to run them all through."" Then, fast, the US ship dropped             the British flag, raising the US flag (because the US Navy is             honorable as shit and said they would not attack anyone with a US             ship not flying the US flag) then disabled the pirate ship. The             pirates (not being honorable) surrendered and when US marines             boarded the ship the pirates started shooting and attacking them,             only to be overtaken AGAIN and eventually taken all prisoner. <br>             <br>             Anyway, long and short of it, the book was amazing, anyone with ANY             interest in amazing stories, history, people, ideas, stuff or even             things would love this book!"

I believe this book is about her journey through first               trying to understand them through statistics to realizing that               that simply is not possible. Superficially, Ms. O'Neil is writing               about the poor power of prediction of mathematical models when               applied to people, or how these models can amplify unconscious               bias against certain minority groups. But what I think the author               is really writing about is what a difficult time she has had               understanding the people in her life. Like most autism spectrum researchers turned authors, we kick off with a great story about how ""Big Data"", if used improperly can have  devastating effects. This is because (writes O'Neil) big data analysis is an automatic process once the model is built and               accepted, that is, it is hard to know<span>&nbsp;</span><i>why</i>&nbsp;a               model ""spits-out"" a particular answer given a particular input, so               mostly, it just needs to be either accepted or not. Unintended               bias crops up when, say, a bank is trying to decide how much               interest to charge a customer. Lets say our Bankers are honest and               good and do not want to discriminate based on race so they strive               to not include that type information in their model. Later they               may find that (statistically) they<span>&nbsp;</span><i>are</i>&nbsp;discriminating  based on race, even if their model only includes variables like income, age, location, home size, past loans, etc. Thus, in a case like this, ""Big Data"" fails to produce an unbiased result, one               which may never be caught unless another analysis is done after               the fact, though this is rarely done in industry says, O'Niel.               <br>               I would not recommend this book. It is for no one. Not for data               scientists, O'Neil's insights are not profound, they are               interesting, but nothing new. Not for laymen, even given the               excellent writing and (for the uninitiated) eye opening ideas, I               don't think there are many in that category who care to know how these algorithms work but also don't already know that modern frequentist statistics is seriously flawed.              <br>            After finishing the book I right away watched her TED""                 talk</a>&nbsp;and was disappointed to find it almost word for               word the opening book chapter, same with a<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQHs8SA1qpk""                 style=""color: rgb(0, 158, 184); font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue Light&quot;, HelveticaNeue-Light, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; outline: none; text-decoration: none; transition: color 0.3s ease 0s; display: inline;"">few</a><span>&nbsp;</span><a                 href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK87rN4xpqA"" style=""color: rgb(0, 158, 184); font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue Light&quot;, HelveticaNeue-Light, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; outline: none; text-decoration: none; transition: color 0.3s ease 0s; display: inline;"">other</a><span>&nbsp;</span><a                 href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3up4PezpthU"" style=""color: rgb(0, 158, 184); font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue Light&quot;, HelveticaNeue-Light, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; outline: none; text-decoration: none; transition: color 0.3s ease 0s; display: inline;"">talks</a><span>&nbsp;</span>I               tried.

Superficially the author, Calum Chace, is writing about             the loss of jobs to machines and how this has been a fear for all of             the industrial revolution, but, ""this time really is different"".           <br>          Calum explains why before it was manual             labor but this time machines are coming for our ""cognitive"" or             intellectual tasks. How will society deal with mass unemployment?             Universal basic income says&nbsp; weather the machine owners (or AI             copyright holders) like it or not.            <br>                  All in all a great book on the near term             incoming jobs crisis for the non-programmers out there, or as Calum             puts it, all struggles in the future will be between the Gods and             the Useless."

The             beauty is, that just about anyone can do it, no matter what your             current situation. The steps are incredibly simple and if followed,             essentially are guaranteed to make you, super rich. <br>             <br>             According to Cardone, the secret to getting rich is a three part             plan, and here it is. <br>             <br>             <div style=""text-align: center;"">~~~~~~~Spoiler Alert~~~~~~~</div>             <br>             <blockquote>1) Poor people save for stuff. They save for               emergencies, vacations, cars, retirement, they save now to spend               later. The super rich (or soon to be super rich) save to invest,               all else be damned.<br>               <br>               2) Live like you're broke. Every check, put away as much of it as               you possibly can, leaving just barley enough to live on (if not               less), and NEVER touch the savings except to invest it.<br>               <br>               3) Manage ""income flows"". Ask yourself, ""who has my money"" (i.e.               money you can possibly get) and no matter how small, look for               additional income flows from those people and as soon as one               income flow can be ignored move on. Work to build and stabilize               one income flow, then look for the next. This takes working harder               and longer than anyone else around you. Ignore friends and family,               do not take vacations. Number one rule (of rule number 3) you are               always working. </blockquote>             <br>             Cardone tells us we can expected this to take somewhere around a             decade, during which time we are to put absolutely no energy into             anything other than making money and growing our income flows. He             warns us, people around will hate you, you will lose ALL of your             friends and ALL of your family if you do this. People will think you             are a greedy scumbag all the while and do their best to talk you out             of it. Saying things like, they would not want to live like that,             they would not like to spend so much time working. Losing the best             years of your life to just making money, who needs that, I want to             have a REAL LIFE. <br>             <br>             He also tells us that not one of those people who try and talk you             out of becoming super rich would not jump at trading places with you             once you have made it and they still have another 20 years of             working 9-5 to look forward to. So, work your ass off for 10 year,             manage your income flows and live like you're broke, I'm in, let's             all become millionaires together!"

His first book was about how to pick up women, his             follow up, apparently, is about how to keep them. I did not like it,             it was like taking advice from the guy in 5th grade when you're in             4th grade about how to get the girl on the playground to you like             you.<br>             <br>             <br>             Just give her an ice cream cone you get from the lunch room and             after she says thank you, when shes not looking, give her a kiss,             right on the mouth. Normally a girl would be angry but if you just             gave he the ice cream she can't get mad. <br>             -Neil Strauss, The Game and Jimmy Smith, 5th grade <br>             <br>             <br>             I've said too much, given away too many secrets. People like the             dumbest fucking shit and this is no exception. Rolling Stone             magazine was once a bastion of the counter culture, this last decade             has seen sales fall and, in my opinion, had the content go to             sensational Cosmo-like grabbing headlines. Neil Strauss has served             his tenure at the magazine as a staff journalist during this time of             decline, I can't say 100% that the ruin of Rolling Stone is 100% the             fault of just Neil Strauss, but I can say, this book was not that             good, did not include any relationship advice and was kind of gross             in parts.

That is weird, but lets get             on with the review...<br>             <br>             I don't know how many times I will need to be taught the lesson that             the book is always better than the movie but I hope this is the last             time. I have made this mistake in the past, of putting off reading a             book just because it is too popular. Like an idiot I assumed that             between my having seen Jurassic Park, 3 times (!) in theaters I had             nothing to gain from reading the pop SciFi prose of Mr. Crichton.<br>             <br>             But enough on what an idiot I am for ignoring this now SciFi classic             and on to this amazing fucking book. I loved nearly every page, not             to say it was not pandering and dumbed down to the point of sounding             silly in places, e.g. using chaos theory to predicts what will             happen in a particular situation seems silly. A good portion of the             book is devoted to how mathematician, Malcolm, predicted the fall of             the Park because Chaos theory shows that we can not control complex             systems. But that is dumb really, and I hate to say, but this is             exactly the type of silliness I think I was trying to avoid all             these years. Truth be told, while reading I let it all slid because             Mr. Crichton is just that good, to be able to feed us line after             line of scientific mombo-jumbo and leave even us real scientist             begging for more.<br>             <br>             A great book for anyone, even 25+ years on it really still sounds             very modern. I have not been reading many novels but am glad I made             the time for this classic. I am not going to run out looking for my             next Crichton fix, but will certainly try and stay more open minded             about ""popular"" books in the future."

All you would really need             though would be this book! Yuval Harari, the author, tops himself             again and again in every chapter as he masterfully weaves us though             the age of Man, starting with the earliest periods when dozens of             different Human-like animals reluctantly shared the Earth. <br>             <br>             More than anything, I love how he narrates human sentiment through             the ages. Why did it take so many millennia for man to start using             tools, building structures, using money. Most titillating, what made             the sapiens the ones to eventually win out over the many other             species. Essentially, we read, modern man was especially good at             working together in extraordinarily large groups under shared             delusions to slaughter competitors or game en masse. While             Neanderthals would have had a maximum group size of a few hundred             and a hunting party of much fewer H. sapiens could go to battle in             the thousands all fighting for the same ""god"". Presumably this is             what gives us our ability to congregate peacefully around an idea             such as religion, but also use that shared idea to encourage hatred             for a shared enemy. This gives us religion, good memories, big             brains, color vision, war, ability to innovate, trade...<br>             &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>             Sapiens is a book better than I could have imagined books being. An             objective take of our species is exactly what I have always wanted.             So much of this book, taken out of context, could be taboo but in             this undertaking of understanding humanity for what it is, Harari is             free to explore the best and worst of what makes us H. sapiens, like             it or not."

According to author Luke Harding             it is already too late for The Donald, the dossier is real and since             the late 1970's Donald has been courted by and intimately associated             with Russian finance by laundering money through his real estate             properties. The only reason Donald Trump has had any measurable             success is because the Russian government has in the past seen it             fit to prop up his shoddy Finance & Business deals with cheap loans or             outright free money. If the reporting here is true, nearly every             move Donald Trump has made is designed to please, or at least not             disrupt, Russian interests. Taken as a hypothesis, that one of             Trump's main aims is to please the top Russian leadership, the facts             of the case make more sense. Nearly every odd staffing choice he has             made from Manafort ""working for free"", to the creepy bald skeleton             guy, to the no-soul skeleton lady, to the weird right wing             nationalist creeps... They all have some seemingly exploitable             Russian connection that has either been sought after by Trump             directly, or in the opinion of the author, these people are being             put together, and their connections are all tied to Vladimir Putin's             Russia.<br>             <br>             There is no conspiracy theorizing needed in the case of the American             People vs. Donald J. Trump, his actions demonstrate (1) a clear             intention to collude with Russia for gaining ground in the 2016             election and (2) clear cases of money laundering through his             multiple international properties, specifically revealed in the             Panama Papers recently. The guy is a dirt-bag and my only guess is             that Bob Muller right now is just so baffled as to how such a             degenerate got to the White House the FBI is taking more time than             they obviously should be just catching up.<br>             <br>             By the accounts in this excellent book, Trump should be arrested             immediately, so is it that either the book is simply not accurate,             Trump is somehow above the law, or something else is going on,             probably it is the something else thing. No matter what, this is a             great book, Luke Harding is an amazing author/journalist/detective.             Please read this book and please, VOTE!"

Our main character, Gordon, was alive during normal times but it has been 20 years since the &quot;Big War&quot; that ended civilization. After being pushed around by a bunch of bandits and having his camp raided,&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;again&lt;/i&gt;, he is ready to finally stop being Mr. Nice Guy and start kicking ass and taking names. Gordon is just a lonely traveler, making his way west across the decimated United Sates, on foot. He meets all kinds of characters and eventually finds an old Postman&#39;s uniform, so he starts telling people he &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a postman and he travels from town to down picking up and delivering letters in exchange for room and board. The author takes the opportunity this setting allows to show us many vignettes of different types of possible societies in this new world, some good and trying to rebuild, others have turned vicious and cruel.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It is great fun seeing our Hero (Gordon) fight and talk his way across the Western US with only what he carries and his acting skills (he is also an actor (I know its weird)). It is really cringy though when Brin talks about feminism and where it &quot;goes&quot; in a post apocalypse, I won&#39;t get into it but you&#39;ll need to be able to forgive some of his old misconceptions and just plain sexiest opinions in places. But all in all, a great novel, some fun ideas, a great story but a horrible movie."

I didn't want to do it right away, but as like a retirement             project in my 50's, hopefully get the whole family involved running             the operation, BBS answering phones, Q out tailing perps, Em in the             library, scrolling through microfiche newspaper articles late into             the night, me, learning kung fu, spending time in seedy bars,             sneaking around, picking locks.... I thought I might have the eye             for detail, or something even more stupid and romantic about what it             was like to be a private investigator. <br>             <br>             Author, Daniel Ribacoff, as an ex-diamond seller/security man and             later full-time PI, tells us all about the day to day of what it is             like to do this job and gives plenty advice about how to do it.             Bottom line for me was that, like everything, it takes a lot of hard             work to do it right and it might be years before an actual Finance & Business             could be up and running starting from scratch. I loved this book, it             was great having my dream shattered and my ideal future fade to             nothing. How I thought investigating criminals would be anything but             hard work and long hours is beyond me, but Ribacoff makes very clear             what this type of life entails. <br>             <br>             I think this could have been two books, one about how to be a PI, a             how to guide, and a second book that was a memoir of this amazing             man's career. Once I got 1/2 through and realized that I was no             longer interested in my future self being a scruffy PI working from             a small 2nd story office in the bad part of the old downtown, my             focus was lost during the details of specific operations. Aside from             not caring about the specifics of how to follow people for days on             end and how to pee in what and where while on the road I thought it             was a great read and would recommend it."

This amazing author, Tim O'Brien, goes into detail             about that initial loan, but also the following $10 million, then             $30 million loans he received from his father's estate in his early             years.<br>             <br>             For me, the take away of this microscopic look into the life of one             of the dumbest human beings alive, was that some people just get             lucky and fail upwards. Almost comically, Donald has failed at most             of what he has done. He would have made many times more money than             he did over his lifetime had he just taken his father's initial loan             and put it in any stock market index fund.&nbsp; At every failure,             his father was able to bail him out. My FAVORITE example was when             his Dad, Fred Trump, wanted to give his boy Donny $2 million tax             free and fast for his failing casino. Instead of filing paper work             and paying taxes on such a large gift to his son, Fred Trump went to             Donny's casino and bought $2 million worth of poker chips, then             essentially just threw them away (never chased them), netting Donny             a cool $2 mill, tax free.<br>             <br>             Donald Trump is an idiot, at least by the close account of this             book. He is really not much more than son of a rich guy, rich idiot             who has never been allowed to fail completely and (at least before             the election that made us all question our sanity) has had only one             positive quality, that of being amazingly great to watch on reality             TV. O'Brien spent A LOT of time with Trump by the sounds of it and             over all Trump comes off a a great guy. Nice to the people around             him, personable and good at not mixing Finance & Business and the rest of             life. But good God, what a sad misguided idiot he seems to be too.<br>             <br>             If you want a great look into what it is to be Trump, this is the             best account I've yet seen. God help us all, #ReadyForWarren2020"

For a long time I avoided relationship advice, in hindsight I have no idea why but the second I picked up this book I could not stop listening. It genuinely felt that the author was talking about me and I would highly recommend this  title to anyone who may suffer from anxiety or deals with someone on the <i>anxiety-spectrum</i>. <br>  <br>If you are still reading this review, stop I can not say enough good things about author Dr. Phelps and what an amazing job she does describing what life if like for the anxious in love and how important a book it has been for me in understanding this type of person. It is frustrating that I am just now am hearing of the field of attachment types and feel dumb for not looking into this area before (when my sister suggested it to help with marital problems). The basic idea of the attachment theory is that much like personality dimensions, there are 2 (or 4, I am not sure) attachment types. The two types of attachment are anxious and avoidant. The first half of the book goes through how to identify which type you and your partner are and if you are anything like me, will quickly and strongly identify as one or the other. Later Leslie discusses the question of what you can to do if you are in a relationship that struggles with the tension between anxiousness and avoidance personalty types and unfortunately the answer is not much. <br>  <br>Changing core personalty traits is difficult to impossible for many and like others, Dr. Phelps recommends the only tried and true method of essentially repeating aphorisms and forcing positivity until it click, or, fake-it-till-you-make-it. <br>  <br>Although I finished the book feeling there was still no clear path forward for the anxious-in-love out there I did feel great about the fact the people like the author have taken the time to understand the (seemingly) growing epidemic of anxiety and loneliness that follows.

Author Steven Levy delivers with the perfect sub-title. Day-to-day it is lost on us where the technology we use comes from. We might (at most) worry about the manufacturing process, or even the trade in value or where to recycle an old device, but where did the iPhone really come from, why don't monitors flicker any more, is the current technological environment we find ourselves in the inevitable result of the laws of nature and discovery, or<br />was it shaped inexorably by the minds of a select few incredibly hard working and very bright young hackers in the 1960's to<br />1980's?</p> <p>Hackers did it. Who built Apple computers, largest company in the world, hackers. Richest man in the world, a self-described hacker. Why do we have ""word processors"", video games, color screens... literally everything we enjoy today is only because a hacker was there, working night after night, alone on a problem until it was solved.So much of what hackers have innovated may seem so obvious that we can't image technology would have gone any other way, but the internet itself proves a perfect example of why Hackers should be your heroes if they are not already. In the beginning, Internets were closed and the mode was for a centralized database that was only accessible though a gatekeeper.</p> <p>That would have been (that WAS) the internet, until a hacker Tim Berners-Lee hacked up a free ""Web"" accessible World Wide and for free.My point is not to convince to that Hackers should be our god-kings, appointed for life and voted in by fellow Hackers into the Hacker Ruling Elite, it is just that you should read this book. Hackers is amazing because the people it is about literally built from the ground up our current way of life and their stories are amazing. If in the future, after robots have taken all the jobs and the world is divided into the Gods and Useless it is the Hacker forefathers who will be worshiped as Gods of the Gods and demonized by the 99.9% as creators of the monstrous hell that they kick started way back in the early 1960's.</p>"

The invention of a frictionless, low fee, instant, censorship resistant and international digital cash system was the greatest of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. The idea that money could be sent anywhere, anytime for next to no cost and instantaneously captured the imagination of a generation of young tech enthusiast, students of economics and digital natives, for whom an on-line currency made perfect sense.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Aside from the man&rsquo;s invention, Satoshi was undeniably one of the greatest minds in the field of computer science and engineering. His ideas presented though his writings seem perfectly formed, his writing style is perfection and error free as far as I can tell. I absolutely cherished every word of this collection, reading the words of a great mind has a way of making me feel smart and this is a great example of that, Satoshi&rsquo;s explanations are so simple crystal clear it feels as if the invention is obvious, we are all left feeling like we could have invented it, that we are all Satoshi.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>It is hard for me to understand the type of mind that could have produced what Satoshi did, the only reasonable explanation I can come up with is that Satoshi was an academic or state sponsored team of computer scientists. Any normal human would have released the ideas but not the code, or the code but have been unable to explain it as clearly. All evidence is that Satoshi was just a man who spoke British English, had an academic career and lived in the Western hemisphere. But how one man could be such an intellectual giant as to have invented Bitcoin AND have the foresight to understand the importance of staying anonymous. It is just too much to comprehend.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>One man started a revolution, one that no one know where or how it will end. In the end, it may be that this one may will be responsible for the downfall of the internationally banking cartel that has ruthlessly run the world for 100&rsquo;s of years. Satoshi was the hero we all needed right when we needed him. It is only a testament to his greatness that Satoshi and his invention was immediately and continuously attacked by trolls like Greg Maxwell, the legacy banking industry through funding anti-Bitcoin corporations like <u>Block</u>stream, and funding anti-Bitcoin legislation.</p>"

In a multiverse, by defenition, every that             can happen, does happen, every possible version of you that can             exist, does exist somewhere. I know, its crazy. Now image if there             was a portal that connected all deviations of all of the universes,             that is what our good nature genius scientist hero, Jason, has             invented which allows him to travel through the multiverse at will.             Bust, as soon as such a device is able to be invented there will be             at least one version of the inventor who wants to use the invention             for evil and that is just what happnes in the this novel. An evil             version of Jason who has also invetend the same transdimential             portal machine is using it to travel the multiverse searching for             the Jason with the ""perfect life"" so that he can kill him and take             his place, our hero Jason is just that Jason. </div>           <div class=""nine columns""><br>           </div>           <div class=""nine columns"">I loved this book. Loved it. It made me feel             like a teenager reading just one more page then just one more             chapter. The story is incredible, the use of the setting and new             world view of the characters to tell a story about how we like to             think of ourselves as unique people but are not is awesome.<br>             <br>             At one point there are tons of ""copies"" of Jason, some good, some             bad, all trying to get at the same family they think should be             ""rightfully"" theirs, it gets crazy. I didn't cry reading it, but I             could have, it was that good. It was methodical where it needed to             be in describing technology can characters but fast paced at the             same time. It might best be described as a thriller but I think Dark             Matter will go down as a Sci-Fi classic in good time. "

They are impulsive, exciting, daring and most of all, a bunch of idiots, like watching the first or second season of Survivor when it was still good. If you keep up with the news cycle there is nothing new to surprise you in this insider account by author Michael Wolff. This is a fun and personal look into the workings of the Trump White House and the mind of the man himself where the bottom line seems to be that, really, there is just nothing there. When Kellyanne says that there is nothing going on with ""the Russia stuff"", that is probably true, there is nothing going on with anything, everything in the Trump world is minute by minute, second by second, there is no plan, no goal because exactly 0 members of the Trump team ever though there was a chance they would win.<br> <br> For me, this books is really just about how stupid an otherwise functioning human being can be and how many of them there are. By all accounts it is looking like about 30% of American's have some mental disability, couple that with the electoral college, an epic amount of Republican gerrymandering and Russian Internet Trolls we are left with a commander in chief who seems to not be fully literate and thinks that global warming is a Chinese hoax. There is nothing good or interesting going on with this administration, they bumble from one crisis to the next with no short term memory and a general aim of just doing the opposite of whatever the last President did. My personal opinion is that Trump is bad but not nearly as bad as Bush II was and for all his faults Trump comes off as a nothing President who is probably just going to fade away (I hope).&nbsp; If his handlers were to lose control of him, Trump may end up being the worst thing to ever happen to this country but for now, this was a great read and I would recommend it to anyone with the extra time to ""get to know"" our 45 President. <br>"

Schafer writes a             book about how to win people over from the perspective of someone             who would have faild upward almsot no matter what and assumes that             what has worked so miraculously for him would work for anyone. All             in all, a gross book, mundane ""tips"" and a slimy self centered             author.<br>             <br>             For example, this ""tip"" on how to negotiate came with the story of             how one time he spent 8 hours at a car dealership ""negotiating"" the             price of a car. At the end of the 8 hours he took out a check,             wrote, as he puts it, ""a ridiculously low"" offer on it and handed             the check to the now exhausted and exasperated sales woman who has             just had an entire day wasted by this ass hat. He tells us, she             finally did accept my offer as to have not sold ANY car that entire             day would have been a total loss, so she had to accept my low offer.             <br>             <br>             Or, the time his FBI department got a new boss, so he spent the             first couple months being rude and talking poorly about the new boss             and ignoring her at the morning meetings. Then, slowly, he began to             ""warm up"" to the new boss, being nicer and nicer, and then finally             giving public compliments on how great she was. Now the boss likes             him more than the others because at first he made her think that he             didn't like her.<br>             <br>             Or the time he had a suspect who was already in jail for a different             crime and so had the chance to have him one-on-one every day. Every             morning for a week he would bring in the inmate into an interview             room, would offer him a cup of coffee and then just sit there in             silence reading the newspaper calmly. MIRACULOUSLY, after just a few             days the suspect was begging to talk about anything. After a few             more days of just talking about whatever the suspect wanted to each             day, he finally asked about the suspected crime, and MIRACULOUSLY             they just started talking about it like it was any one of their             other conversations!<br>             <br>             Or the time he had a not very smart suspect in the interrogation             room and had his partner leave the room, then lied to the suspect             saying they had a special kind of lie detector that his partner was             going to come back and use on him. When the partner came back in,             they just asked him, ""did you rob the bank"", the guy said, ""No"",             then the ""lie detecting"" partner just said, ""he's lying."" then the             suspect said, ""Wow, how'd he do that!?!"". And they got him. Boom.<br>             <br>             The guy is a sleazeball who has obviously been blinded by his life             of false power in law enforcement. I'm not glad I read this book,             I'm not glad that this type of person even exists. So full of             himself, such an awful book."

If you have any interest in the economy this is a must read/listen to book. The author describes how at the onset he intended to write a book about the 2008 financial crises but once he got started realized that book is simply not possible to write ecause we are still in the 2008 financial crises 10 year later.&nbsp;</p> <p>I both love and hate the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania"">Tulip Bulb Bubble</a>&nbsp;story because it has so little to do with financial bubbles and modern economics it is a joke it is so often referenced, but like in most cases the allegory holds some wisdom. Here, imagine that in the 1600's the Dutch government had decided that the Tulip market was ""too-big-to-fail"", what would have happened?&nbsp;</p> <p>As it did happen, it was an economic disater for a lot of perople, especially the wealthy who had a lot of money tied up in these investment (mostly because they were backed by the Dutch government, just like Fannie May backing US mortages). Rich people saw that Tulip investments had government backing so essentially were ""safe"". But when the market began to fall, the Dutch changed their minds when they realized they could not cover all the ""paper"" debt. It was a big crash to say the least.&nbsp;</p> <p>But, what would have happened if instead the Dutch government&nbsp;had said &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the crash and decided that it was better to instead print enough new money to buy out ALL of the tulip bulb contracts that were vastly over priced (because they had initially decided to back them)? Because that is exactly what happened in 2008.</p> <p>In 2008 the US government was running their own little Tulip Bulb bubble scam. The idea was they would use government institutions (Fannie May to buy up ALL the mortgages they could, then &ldquo;back&rdquo; them from defaulting. Just like when the Dutch did the same thing with Tulip bulbs, government backing sent prices sky high. Not only were they inflating the market, giving (yes GIVING) houses to people that would never be able to pay back the mortgage taken out, they were backing the bad mortgages with Fannie May!</p> <p>Once the world saw there was being, essentially, unlimited debt being created and backed by the US government at greater that 5% interest, there was no question, and the world financial markets started to pile in. This is why the majority of the TARP bail out funds went to foreign banks, like Deuschea Bank, they were the ones holding most of the bad debt, and the US was on the hook for it.</p> <p>The US had no choice but to print $Trillions and hand it out to German, China and Japan.</p> <p>So, what would have happened to the Dutch had they decided to do what we did? Who know but I can bet it would have been a lot worse for everyone involved. The US bailed out FOREIGN banks at the expense of US tax payers. This was not a choice, but still, super messed up to think my grand-kids&rsquo; taxes will probably be going to pay for this bail out for decades to come. In 2018 the 2008 financial crises is not over my friends, it is just getting started.</p>"

Buffett seems to have found himself at the perfect intersection of privilege, luck and genius, in that order. I loved this book and it should be the top non-ficiton book on your to-read list.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>However.</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It seems that most people that learn about Warren Buffett walk away with the wrong message, Buffett is not simply a great stock picker, that is not the story to be told. The real story of Warren Buffett is that he was able to attract more capital investments to himself and his organizations than anyone else in the history of the World because he was seen as a very trustworthy person. What gets forgotten about Warren Buffett is the reason he was so trustworthy is because he was born in the very upper-most echelons of American culture with a Senator father and a wealthy extended family going back generations.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Warren Buffett is indeed not a normal human being, but only because he can </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">afford</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> to be different. it is disgusting to me that the first and only thing that people are not talking about Warren Buffett about is the fact that he came from wealth and power and was able to accumulate more wealth and power, in my book that's barely an accomplishment. Buffett is a near inevitable outcome of his circumstance, nothing more.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Warren Buffett's family owned the largest grocery store chain in the state when he was born. Warren Buffett's father was a US senator. He was able to attend the best schools in the country when he even admittedly applied to graduate school with bad grades no recommendations only days before school started and all he had was the Buffett name to go on.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Becuase of all this privildge Buffett is now FAMOUSLY a stingly asshole to his own children, because of the massive guilt he must suffer from, he is well known for making a show of not giving to &ldquo;charity&rdquo; cases or his children, so he can act as if he believes the only way to make one&rsquo;s way in the world is to start at the bottom and work your way up. The man is a hypocrite of the worst kind, a &ldquo;pull the ladder up behind you&rdquo; kind of rich man. By his own account, </span><a href=""https://dailyreckoning.com/warren-buffett-hypocrite-extraordinaire/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">he pays just over 14% income tax</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, lower than the vast majority of middle class Americans.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Warren Buffett went from being one of the most privileged people in America to being the richest person in America. The key to Warren Buffett&rsquo;s success was not his investment acumen, as he himself describes is extremely straight forward, what made Warren Buffett a success was that he started wealthy, had an ability to solicit millions of dollars from rich connections for his Finance & Business ideas and then plow &ldquo;excess money&rdquo; into stable long-term investments starting at a very young age.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">No other 20 year old in this day and age would be able to attract multi-million dollars investors into their projects and ideas without having some sort of very strong connections and in Warren's case it was his father being a wealthy senator. Still in his twenties Warren buffett's investment company had a policy to not disclose anything about how Warren was investing people's money he would only give them a once yearly report on how the investment did, today that would be an incredibly shady proposition.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Now that I've done my best to shit on Warren Buffett's lifetime of achievement I do want to say this was an incredible book I loved hearing about Warren Buffett every second of his life is interesting to me he is a beautiful human being and if everybody could be a little bit more like Warren Buffett this world could be a better place.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">My only point is that Warren Buffett is an anomaly, not a one in a million stock picker, but a 1 percenter that leveraged his father's game and connections to solicit huge amounts of money at a very young age and invest it very conservatively over a long period of time.&nbsp;</span></p>"

The author of The history of Time travel informs us that information can and does travel through time in the form of gravitational waves. The collapse of a neutron star rapidly, sends a signal throughout all timelines the death of a star is a timeless event so in some sense.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The history of time travel is hands-down the best book about time travel I've ever read. The most important thing to know about time travel is that it doesn't exist. The second most important thing to know about time travel is that it will never exist. If we compare the two-dimensional flatlander if we compare the amount of energy and transcendental you point it would take for a flatlander to project their mind into the third dimension we can see the difficulty one might have in imagining the 4th travel throughout the 4th.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Reality is incredibly detailed and the space time continuum is little understood. For instance we can define the 4th dimension but not a human being that is ever lived has been able to imagine it.&nbsp;</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Time exists at a right angle to the third spatial dimension.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Time exists at the right angle to the third spatial dimension. What in God's name could that possibly mean, what is a right angle to empty space in what direction does time go?&nbsp;</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The author tries to answer these questions fruitlessly but valiantly and he does through an exploration of the history of time travel.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Of course there is next to nothing as far as real scientific research goes into time travel. The official story stops when physicists tell us that in fact time does not exist and is nothing more than an emergent property of our perspective but getting old sure as hell feels real. So the only place the author has for source material left is the world of science fiction and perhaps humanity's greatest contribution to storytelling and scientific storytelling, my hero, Robert A. Heinlein.</span></p> <p><br /><br /></p>"

I really liked the short-lived show on Amazon called, Transparent. It is about a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; liberal West Coast wealthy family getting on in life, at one point the doofy eldest daughter has an idea to write a book about raising kids and a philosophy she calls, &ldquo;Kids on Top&rdquo;. Its hilarious, trust me. This book is not far off from that concept, parents have spent way too much time looking down on their kids and not getting down to their level. It is at best an unfortunate case that all people need to start life as tiny and helpless. Just imagine how it feels to know nothing except helplessness, it must be hard.&nbsp;</p> <p>Putting yourself in the shoes of your kids is a lot of what this book is about. They use phrases like, &ldquo;get down on their level&rdquo;, &ldquo;ask, don&rsquo;t tell&rdquo; and, well you get the idea right? Kids on top.</p> <p>It all sounds great but I will give one specific example for why I don&rsquo;t think it works</p><br><i> <p>How to deal with a tantrum.</p></i> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>Step 1. Find out what is going on.</strong>&nbsp;Ask them how they are feeling or what happened to them.</p> <p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>Step 2. Listen to them.&nbsp;</strong><em>Why</em>&nbsp;are the upset, what are they&nbsp;<em>trying</em>&nbsp;to say?&nbsp;</p> <p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>Step 3. G</strong><strong>et on their level.</strong>&nbsp;Try and&nbsp;<em>feel</em>&nbsp;what they are feeling. If they are angry, tell them how you can get angry too and you know just how it feels.&nbsp;</p> <p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>Step 4. Distract them.</strong>&nbsp;Once you have their attention and are on their level, get them to move to something else nearby.</p> <p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>Step 5. Revisit the situation.</strong>&nbsp;After everyone is calmed down, up to a few days later, bring up the problem and talk through what happened, why and what we could do better next time.</p> <p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Lets try it out at home.</em></p> <p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">&nbsp;</p> <p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">One night, we find the boy (four) having a fit about a toy his sister is playing with.&nbsp;</p> <p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>Step 1,</strong> find out what happened. He is being a jerk to his sister because he wants the toy, ok, step 2.</p> <p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>Step 2, </strong>listen. &ldquo;Son, why are you upset what do you need?&rdquo;. Son, &ldquo;She has my TOYY! I WANT IT!!!!&rdquo; So far so good</p> <p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>Step 3,</strong> get on his level. So kneeling down I say, &ldquo;[boy] I know. I know just what you mean. I want stuff a lot of the time that I can&rsquo;t have and it stinks, I know just how you feel and I love you.&rdquo;, him, &ldquo;AAAAAAAhhhhggggg!&rdquo; and runs away screaming after knocking over a potted plant on his way out of the room screaming, ""Go Away Forever!""&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This was still a great book, a great perspective and the authors do an amazing job, it just didn&rsquo;t work as advertised for me.</p>"

While watching an interview with him on Bill Maher I went a googln' and was quickly weirded out by what I found. As best as I can tell, there is an internet army of small minded, mostly young males who support Trump, are out of work and addicted to opiates. I did not know this, but apparently it is happening. Dr. Peterson has addressed his set of ""directions for life"" to them in an effort to get them to turn their lives around, learn/earn their own worth and start taking some responsibility. I say that is a noble goal and somehow, in addressing this group of downtrodden westerner beta and omega males, Dr. Peterson has produced a book that anyone should be able to find some benefit from, even if just better understand the people around us.</p> <p>&nbsp;   <br>This is a great book, I loved hearing his take of many classic stories from the Old Testament reinterpretations to him explaining just what Pinocchio was really all about (its actually pretty cool :). As a University Professor, Dr. Peterson really comes off as such, his extremely well practiced and focused ramblings are the riveting tales of an old man around a campfire, layered, wise and captivating.   <br>   <br>It is enough to know that it is a great book with a lot of good, general advice for life, one of my favorite parts was the following, his list of nine ""Rules for Kids"", here it is paraphrased: </p> <p style=""margin-left: -2px; text-align: center;"">   <br> </p> <h5 style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-size: 18px;""><strong>Nine Rules for Kids</strong></span></h5> <p style=""margin-left: 20px;"">1. No hitting, kicking or biting, except in self-defense (so you don't end up in jail).   <br>2. Don't torture or a bully other kids (so you don't end up in jail).   <br>3. Eat in a civilized and thankful way (so people are pleased to feed you).   <br>4. Share with other kids (so that they will play with you).   <br>5. Pay attention, stand up straight and talk to adults (so they don't hate you and might teach you something).   <br>6. Go to sleep peaceably (so that your parents can have a private life and not resent your existence).   <br>7. Take care of your belongings (because you need to learn how and we are lucky to have them).   <br>8. Be good company when there is fun around (so you will be invited to the fun next time).   <br>9. Act like you are happy that other people are around (so that they will be happy when you are around). </p> <p>   <br> </p> <p>Dr. Peterson read this book himself for Audible and did an amazing job. At one very endearing point towards the end of Chapter 8 the author's voice begins to give. For a good 5 minutes he pushes through (sounding absolutely horrible) but the fact that he doesn't stop seems to be in line with the theme of the book.</p> <p>   <br> </p>"

Written just in 2017 Borne could have been written anytime in the last 50 years, which for me is key to any good sci-fi, that it not give away the era in which it was written. I always cringe when a story tells of how some minor technology that was new at the time, explodes and is predicted to have a bigger impact than it did. <br> <br> Though a great book, Borne is guilty of the above, Jeff VanderMeer, the author, goes haywire with the idea of ""bio-tech"" in only a way that someone that had no understanding of what ""bio-tech"" is, could do. For VanderMeer, bio-tech is apparently akin to magic, and  it is offenders like him that are to be blamed for blurring line lines between Sci-Fi and fantasy (a crime in my book). <br> <br>Despite breaking all my rules, of being not ""real sci-fi"" and going of the deep end, clearly delving into fantasy for long intervals where super powers are just a ""shell"" away and bio-tech can grow unchecked by the laws of physics, despite this, I still loved, Borne. <br> <br>If you want to know what Borne is about, its hard to say. ""Bio-tech"" run amuck, young love, dystopia porn with a healthy does of fantastic nonsense that in any other book would have had me pulling out the earbuds after 5 minutes, but not Borne, I loved Borne, no, I love Borne, and Borne love me, because Borne loves everyone.

If you have, you may have come away with             the vague feeling that no one has any idea what really happened and             never will. Almost certainly though, the official ""Lone Gunman""             theory, just doesn't quite add up. If this has ever bugged you,             author Collin McLaren is ready and eager to scratch that itch in             this excellent piece of investigative journalism! McLaren perfectly             lays out what is known about that day and from a law enforcement             perspective, what is most likely to have taken place. Almost             certainly Oswald would not have been able to fire three shots as was             detailed in the Warren commission. Aside from some impossibly grand             conspiracy, the only other logical explanation for the assassination             and following cover up is, wait for it... (unless you already know             the answer, but for everyone else...), it was... an accident. Yep,             the fatal mistake was accidentally made by Secret Service agent             George Hickey, riding in the car behind the President. Oswald would             have been perched ahead (and above) of the motorcade and shot             twice.&nbsp; It was the car behind the President that attempted to             return fire after the first shot, essentially over the President's             head toward the book depository. For whatever reason, that fateful             bullet instead of being aimed at the book depository hit the             President in the back of the head, causing the famous forward             jerking motion after exploding the back of the head onto the rear of             the vehicle. <br>             <br>             Anyway, if you want to read one Australian man's fairly reasonable             conclusion of what might have happened that day, this is a great             read. McLaren sounds like a great private dick and he clearly is             both qualified to have undertaken this massive investigation and in             his conclusions based on available evidence. I know there is a movie             too and tried to get the significant other watch it with me, but             having just put kids to sleep we were having trouble enjoying the             multiple close up replays of the infamous head-shots right at the             beginning of the film and turned it off after about 10 minutes."

For here, I'll tone it down a bit: whether you agree with it or not,&nbsp;<em>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</em>&nbsp;is a profoundly important book and will continue to dominate economic and policy discussions for years.<br /><br />The very title is a provocation. The use of the word 'Capital' calls to mind Karl Marx's major investigation on the nature of money,&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/238953.Das_Kapital"" rel=""nofollow"">Das Kapital</a>. Piketty is anything but an orthodox Marxist, or anything orthodox at all. His dismissal of the concept of the labor theory of value would upset traditional Marxists, and his conclusions on the natures of capitalist free market systems would anger the neo-Classicals and Austrians.<br /><br />The second thing you'll notice is that Piketty heavily relies on statistical analysis. Many of his citations lead to an external database, which can be found&nbsp;<a href=""http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/fr/capital21c"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. One of the chief struggles in economics is the split between developing theoretical models and statistical analysis. Piketty refuses to build the theory first, and much of the book is structure around the data. The primary focus of his study is France. This is not from national chauvinism, but from the wealth of well-maintained data which dates back to the revolutionary era in the 1790s. He does also refer to other developed countries in Western Europe and the United States. The scale and nature of his methods indicate the scale of his topic - inequality.<br /><br />The first part of the book is a framing of how markets and national economies work. He begins with a historical examination of other theories, start with the early classical economist David Ricardo and ending with the modern development theories of Simon Kuznets. Piketty focuses on a re-examination of the role between assets and income, and how much capital growth increases faster than the growth of the rest of the economy. If capital incomes are more concentrated than those from labor, then those who get income from stored capital instead of their labor will have their income increase faster than the national growth rate.&nbsp;<br /><br />This leads to a reinterpretation of the past two centuries of economic history. The most stunning conclusion is that the nature of industrial capitalism will necessarily contribute to further income inequality. The only exception to this rule has been the 30 years after the end of WWII and ending with the oil shock and end of the gold standard.</p>"

Rick figures it out and finally they make a daring escape from the VR, they remove the interface helmets and start to run away from the evil alien facility. As they run the camera zooms out and we see that our heroes are actually still in a now larger virtual world, designed in a way that makes them only think they have escaped into the real world.

Bring von Humboldt back to the forefront of the American mind and 90% of our problems will be solved, put this book in the hands of every teenager and half our issues would disappear overnight. I&rsquo;m calling for it now, Humboldt needs to be the hero of generation Z, he needs to be, as he deserves, a name synonymous with genius.&nbsp;</span></p>"

Based in a future of crumbling, abandoned cities and a tightly controlled population of survivors controlled by an elite group of surgically enhanced super humans, this book is easy to follow and easier to understand. You can listen to this book while driving, working g in the woodshop or cleaning the house and not be distracted from your task.'<br><br> There are some cool ideas that keep your interest, this book is poppin' with hover boards, genitcally modified orchids and brain damaged slaves. There are some brief periods of puke-in-my-mouth teenager romance, but I made it through those with minimal disruptions.

If you were looking to get your hands on McCabe&rsquo;s resume, this book will do just fine. The Threat was a well written memoir from a white color lawyer turned FBI douche bag. It was well worth the time invested to hear a few stories from the &ldquo;inner&rdquo; FBI, but overall, McCabe is a jackass, a clever jackass, so we are better off not completely trusting any of his perspectives. Two good examples, McCabe glancingly addresses the Snowden revaluations and the Hillary Clinton e-mail scandal. As far as the Snowden issues go, the author was clearly on the side that wanted Edward not only apprehended but saw him as a terrorist of the worst kind. You can feel the hate McCabe and his kind have for Snowden in the way he talks about the &ldquo;damage&rdquo; done by Snowden releasing classified documents. The man shows his true colors and it seems clear that McCabe is a fascist in the sense that he expects the government should have full access to any aspect of all Americans&rsquo; lives at all times.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>At no point does he attempt any apology for being a part of pre-Snowden law enforcement. Never does he or does he sound capable of questioning the mass illegal spying programs the FBI used and profited from so eagerly and calls Snowden a <em>criminal</em>, of all things. He says there is no reason for private citizens to expect ANY privacy from the US government, and scoffs at the idea of companies like Apple encrypting uses&rsquo; data and then refusing to give the FBI the cryptographic key to EVERY single customer. Like I say, the man is a self proclaimed fascist.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>It is great to hear McCabe stumble over himself as he tries to explain and justify what happened with Hilary Clinton and her lost e-mails. Until this book I had taken the e-mail &ldquo;scandal&rdquo; as nothing more than idiot Fox News Pizza Gate nonsense. But it turns out, Hilary made a massive mess for the FBI. McCabe tells how when Hilary started at the State Department she was issued a government email address and told to use it for all official communication. Instead she choose to pay a private company to run her email for her, not the us government. There was no reason to do this, it cost a lot of money and the only reason to do it would be to keep data private. After she did this for years against all requests and recommendations it turns out that about &frac12; of her emails had gotten lost my her own employees, a mistake that would never happen had she done what she was told she needed to. Now the FBI didn&rsquo;t just throw up their hands and say oh well, guess &frac12; of the Secretary of State&rsquo;s emails are gone forever, no, its the fucking FBI, they go and get those fucking emails, and thats hard.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>McCabe tells about how they had to painstakingly get court ordered access to every email address mailbox that Hilary had potentially sent email to from her officail account, then sort through ALL the emails from ALL the people that she MIGHT have sent an email to. A massive efforts that cost a lot of money explains McCabe, so while not enough to &ldquo;lock her up&rdquo;, it was a huge time and money waster and still ended up with thousands of &ldquo;missing&rdquo; emails. It did not even end there, the FBI also had to get access to ALL laptops or devices Hiliary might have used, then recovered as much deleted data off the hard drives, another huge effort that should never had to have happen. Comey could have done little else than stating publicly what happened, if anyone else did what Hilary did they would have been disqualified from ever handling secret information ever again, let alone be allowed to hold public office. McCabe makes clear that the email scandal was real and and the FBI did what they did in the best interest of Hilary Clinton, did their best to cover for a massive screw up.</p>"

For many they are only looking for what Obama supporters wanted a decade ago, hope. They are guilty only of being desperate for a better tomorrow and it is the number one reason they were so easily duped by this horrible con man.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style=""line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;""><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">&ldquo;<a title=""Trump's American Carnage - The Atlantic"" href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/02/trump-carnage/553424/"">American Carnage</a>&rdquo; is a Steve Bannon phrase taken from Trump&rsquo;s inaugural address as well&nbsp; as the title of this great book all about how Donald Trump became president. This books is just barely about Trump, the focus is the Republican party 2016-2017 and its complete and utter destruction. The reasons Trump became president turn out to be relatively straightforward and simple, foremost Hillary was without question the worst candidate ever put forward by the Democratic party. With her long history of corruption and abuse of power it is no wonder she was so well hated. Second was the ability of the Republican party and more than anyone Republican strategists like <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Luntz"">Frank Luntz</a> and Karl Rove who were able to boil down exactly where and when Trump needed to spend his time campaigning. Along with the decades long perverse work of The GOP all over the country in gerrymandering their districts in order to maximize the poll of each Republican voter while minimizing Democrats influence.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style=""line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;""><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">Republicans are the party of do anything, say anything to win, in this case all they had to do was pledge loyalty to Donald Trump, one of the most repugnant men in American History. More than anything what put Donald over the top was middle class voters who's number one issue in this last election was reportedly the nomination of Supreme Court Justices. His first nomination was only possible because of Mitch McConnell's blocking of Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland in a completely insane and unheard of manner. The lesson of American Carnage is that luck favors the prepared and the Republicans had been preparing for well over 8 years. The bad news is, it worked they were exceedingly successful in mobilizing their base on the most important issues for them, Mitch McConnell&rsquo;s Supreme Court nominee and forcing women to have babies they don&rsquo;t want.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><br /><br /></p>"

The hero is a future moon colony inhabitant that works with an artificially intelligent computer to rebel against the evil imperialists from Earth who exploit the Moon workers. Plot wise, that is all you need to know as this books is all about world building at its best. The character development of the computer AI is genius, as our hero needs to teach the computer to be more human we learn about what that means and how much is often taken for granted. Heinlein explores what humor would be like for a machine, what love means and what it is to be free in a world where we are all a slave to circumstances, its fucking amazing.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style=""line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;""><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">Heinlein succeeded in writing the best AI we have ever seen. So many authors are lazy as hell with &ldquo;AI&rdquo; character development and give us just a hyper intelligent humanoid, only Heinlein took the time to think though what real AI would be like, kind of dumb and useless at most stuff but amzing at a few things. What a lot of authors miss is that an AI can not understand MOST of the human experience. The majority of what makes people people is off limits to a disembodied consciousness and so it would be very hard if not impossible to even communicate with. As an example, even small changes in commands could produce radically different results and a machine will never develop emotions only reproducible results of statistical tests and a set of rules. The nature of man and machine is so radically different that any common ground would be difficult to maintain. The simple idea that AI can be switched off, stored and later switched back on means there is a default immortality to any AI, how would an immortal decorporate hyper intelligence be different than our own? We have no idea but we can say it would be completely unrecognizable, Heinlein does the best of any author I&rsquo;ve seen in accepting this fact and I loved the exploration it allowed.&nbsp;</span></p>"

I thought this was a great story and read it             once and then again right away with my wife on the way back from             seeing the eclipse. It is sad, slow and lonesome with an ending that             feels like having a horse dropped on you, I imagine. A really great             author and amazing read.<br>             <br>             You, like me, are probably the kind of person that likes to spend a             lot of their time thinking about how horrible life can be for the             downtrodden. What an absolute hell life is for people who society             ignores, or even worse, persecutes, generally for no good reason at             all. Trying to survive in a world where just being yourself openly             would be enough invite physical violence from your very community             members, the people you at one time thought you could trust. Annie             Proulx does an amazing job of describing what it is like keeping a             secret from your spouse, a secret so big you're not sure if your             partner really even knows who you are, because all they have ever             known of you is a lie.<br>             <br>             Life is messed up for everyone in different ways but I think that             there are lessons to be learned from those that have gone through             the most trying situations, even if it is just in stories, and good             god is this a roller-coaster of a doozy.<br>             <br>             I have not read any other Annie Proulx but will be sure to. I would             recommend this short story, it's going for $2 on Amazon and would             make for a nice replacement to a movie night (it is very short). Buy             two and have a read-in book club book (it is very very short)."

The author by any measure of the word is a genius having influenced human life on Earth as much as any one might hope to do.

Just keeping this some in your mind as you play you'll gain and statistical advantage over the dealer if you increase your bet as the sum grows. Hedge funds initially where designed to have just above a zero-sum gain where for every purchase in the market an attempt would be made to purchase an equal amount of a security that move inversely to the first.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I really like this book and admire the man as much as anyone but my God doesn't make you feel small to hear about the regular and mass of accomplishments this man had over his lifetime.</span></p>"

I loved it but I'm pretty sure she took it as a personal attack just like most American&rsquo;s under the age of 80 will.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fantasyland rails against the made-up nonsense world that many Americans are today living in. The world where capitalism is King, the world where what you feel is just important as what is and opinions are just as important as facts. According to this book and my personal observation most of the people living in the United States today cope with the stresses of modern life by retreating into their own personal fantasies and ignoring reality as much as possible.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What is Fantasyland? Fantasyland is the world where everyone is equal and must be compensated equally. Fantasyland is the world where hard work is repaid with success and money. Fantasyland is the world that Americans inhabit when they believe that there are no consequences to buying cheap Chinese goods or Mexican cartel grown avocados and The Federal Reserve system is the best we can do. In short Fantasyland is everything that is wrong with America but is also central to America's ability to succeed. It is the ability to ignore reality, it is the right to construct your own world where what you believe is just as important that's what actually exists.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fantasyland is </span><a href=""https://www.somagnews.com/amber-heard-go-prison-falsely-accusing-johnny-depp/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">the land of Amber Heard</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, the horrible evil woman who accused Johnny Depp of physically attacking her after she was the one who had attacked him. How is it that a famous woman could get away with a bald-faced lie to the court, the public and her husband about being physically abused and everyone believed her? That can only happen in Fantasyland where </span><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">belief</span></em><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> itself is the starting point.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Certain types have a hard time in Fantasyland, especially autistics who more naturally see a less distorted version of reality. Greta has said it herself, autism makes it hard to lie to others but also to yourself.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In my opinion the millennial generation and the United States was pique Fantasyland, the world where everyone deserves everything and no one is at fault for anything. Only the most privileged generation in the history of the world could occupy such a nonsense mentality. Financially, the average American is in something like the top 0.5% in the world, yet we were central to the &ldquo;fight for the 99%&rdquo; protests, a literal nonsensical stand to take. Fighting for the 99% would have meant pledging to send 50% of your income oversees, or sponsoring poor families in the third world. Not yelling about how the top 0.5% should really be in the 0.1% and the top 0.001% brought down an order of magnitude. This was a great read but if you are a citizen of Fantasyland stay away. You will not be happy with this book.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I love nearly everything about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez but the simple fact is is she's vying for Queen a Fantasyland. AOC lives in the world where everyone deserves health care where everyone deserves a job where everyone deserves to be happy. It is a fantasy occupied by idiots who have never had to step foot in the real world. People suffer, for a brief blip of time this last 70 years the West has had a respite from the brutishness of life but it never really went away, just for the wealthy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Citizens of Fantasyland believe that decisions are made at the top and that if you're not getting what you want it's because you're being abused or oppressed. The biggest challenge for occupants of Fantasyland is trying to figure out who their oppressors are. For women it's often men, for minorities it's whites, for the poor whites it's the government...&nbsp;</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Conservatism may be a mental disorder but on the other end, liberals living in Fantasyland are capable of doing just as much harm.</span></p>"

Most importantly in <a href=""https://amzn.to/35riv9L""  rel=""noopener nofollow"" ><em  >The System: Who Rigged It, How We Fix</em></a>, he lays out why 40 to 50% of the country is not racist in xenophobic, they are simply trying to get ahead and accomplish what they were told would be possible through hard work and playing fair.</p>  <p><em  >The System</em> crystalizes how in the current two-party dynamic we have one group as the party for millionaires and billionaires and a second option for the professional class and free handouts to minorities. In an amazing turn of events the US has no one currently pushing for the rights and well-being of our largest group of people, the lower to middle income working class.</p>  <figure  ></figure><p>We have well over 40% of America being not only ignored but demonized as racist bigots for no other reason than they are looking for support. A neam majority of American’s have been beat down and are looking to anything and anyone that can make them feel slightly less bad about themselves, even if that means blaming others. In short, the demonization of Trump voters as racist xenophobes has done far more to tear this country apart than Trump himself could ever do.</p>  <p>This book explains the Trump voter perfectly. They are people that have felt left behind, neglected and pushed aside by the society that brought them up. The society that promised them the American dream meant that the only limit to their success was their own willingness to work hard and play by the rules.</p>  <p>Being fed the LIE of work hard and get ahead your entire life can only be stomached for so long before people start looking for any other option, any other explanation for what’s gone wrong.</p>  <figure  ></figure><p>This is not to say anything positive about Donald Trump in any way. At best, Donald Trump was a smoke screen for the oligarchy who got everything they wanted with Trump’s four years. All this goes to show is that Trump was able to use the right kind of rhetoric to convince the working class that he would be the people’s champion, however false it may have been in the end, it worked. Trump did far more to help his own oligarchical, born rich class, than even the Democrats would have but the one thing he did do was understand the pain and need of his constituents, something even Democratic socialists like AOC continue to fail at.</p>  <p>Until the Democrats are able to return to their roots as the party of the working class demigod dogs like Trump will continue to surface at regular intervals to take advantage of the pain and the feelings of being left behind of the majority of the United States</p>  <p>As much as the oligarchy and Democratic party want the world to believe that the support for Trump was racist and xenophobic based, the truth is it was an anti-establishment movement hijacked by a rich kid sociopath. What people have a hard time understanding is that Bernie and Trump supporters are cut from the same cloth, they are anti-establishment movement that was looked down upon, ridiculed and abolished before it had a chance.</p>  <p>At the end of 2020 we are now back to square one where we have a disenfranchised angry 40% of the population who have been demonized for nothing more than believing the lies they were told about working hard to get ahead and the American dream. As with covid, the second wave may very well be worse than the first and it’s no one’s fault but our own.</p>  "
